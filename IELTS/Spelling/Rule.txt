1. Keep writing - Note down the misspelled words
2. Frame a sentence to remember the words
3. User podcast - Listen to the dictation and try to practise

1. i before e - except after c
2. cvc - consonant + vowel + c => plan + er = Planner
fat + er = fatter
3. Y + suffic -> y become i only if the word before is consonant
happy + er = happpier
4. Drop the e - when suffic stats with vowel
but if the suffic start with consonant - e stays
use + age -> usage
