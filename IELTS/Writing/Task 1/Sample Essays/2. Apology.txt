Formal: 

I am writing to apologize for not being at the budget meeting yesterday afternoon. I know these meetings are important, especially when we are making plans for the final quarter.
Unfortunately, a delay kept me from attending.

The reason I was not there is that my meeting with the Chief Financial Officer regarding the Penske project ran an hour late. As you know, Mr. Wallaceâ€™s office is on the 34th floor of the Finley building and by the time we finished, it was already a quarter past three.

I have followed up to make sure I have all the budget information. Alice is going to provide me with the forecast and Jane will be sending me the minutes. I am also having lunch with Jack today and he will answer any questions I may have about what was discussed.

Again, I am sincerely sorry that I was unable to attend and hope you understand the circumstances that led to my absence.

Yours truly,

John Watson


Semi-formal:

Dear Sandy,

I'm so sorry that I didn't make it to your dinner party. I know that you worked hard planning the get together and that you were expecting me to be there with the others. I can't believe I missed it and I'm completely to blame. 

Unfortunately, there was a mix-up with my phone's calendar. When I added the event, I accidentally set the date for the week ahead so I thought the party was next Friday. I know technology is supposed to make our lives easier but I'm the worst with it. 

In fact, when you were trying to call me last night, I was sitting in the movie theatre with my smartphone shut off. Then I forgot to turn it on again and didn't get your messages until this morning when I powered it up. 

I hope that you got the flower arrangement and wine I had delivered today. To further make up for this blunder, if you are available, I'd like to have you and Bob over for dinner next weekend. I'll make your favourite, seafood lasagna. 

Please accept my apologies. 

Sincerely, 

Janice
