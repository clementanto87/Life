Dear Sir / Madam,

My name is Mark Roberts and I am writing to you regarding a Nokia camera that I bought at your department store on Sunhill Road, Dewsbury, on the 5th of September.

The camera seemed to work fine in the shop. However, upon returning home, it became clear that the shutter mechanism was not functioning properly. In addition to this, there was a small scratch on the lens.

I, therefore, returned to the shop the following day, on the 6th of September, and spoke to a company representative about the issue. I left the camera with the assistant and they assured me that they would look into the problem with a view to repairing the camera and get back to me a few days later.

However, it has now been one week and when I contacted the shop again they said that the camera has still not been fixed and they do not know how long it will be.

As I am sure you will understand, it is not acceptable to be waiting for such a long time for it to be repaired. I would, therefore, like to request that I be given a full refund should I not receive the repaired camera by the end of this week.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully
Mark Roberts
