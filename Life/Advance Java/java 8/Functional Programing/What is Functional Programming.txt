What is functional programing?

	Most successful programing approach is OBJECT oriented programming approch; 

	But functional programing approaches has some user,
			1. when working with multi-thread environment,
			2. Working on the stream of data's.


2 Important concepts of functional programming:

	1. Avoid mutable state,
	2. Statless - Functions,
	3. Only method scope variable should be used.

1. Avoid mutable state:
		
		public void add(int a, int b){
				this.total = a + b; // here we are modifing the state of the object inside the method.
		}

2. Statless - functions or methods:
		
		public void add()
		{
				this.total = this.a + this.b; // here we are reading the state of the object to perform the addition operations
		}
