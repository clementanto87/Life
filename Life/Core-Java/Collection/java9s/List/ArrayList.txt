List:

	It is similar to the array; But it dynamically grow.

	It store the elements in the order manner and no sorting by default.


Array List:
	
	We can see different method of ArrayList class	

	1. add(Object);

	2. add(index,object);

	3. clone() -> create a exact copy of the existing collection object 

	4. contains() -> check the element present in the list ********** it required internal implementation of equals and hashcode

	5. get(index) -> get the element or object based on the index.

	6. indexOf() -> returns the index of the object -> it make use of equals and hashcode.


Best Practice:
_______________
	1. user isEmpty() -> to check to the emptyness of the list -> instead of using the size.

	2. for the iteration -> get the size store it on local variable and loop over that

	for(int i=0; i<sizeOftheList; i++)

	3. Make sure we can user the ensure capacity -> but not assure of it
