final: 3

1. Class -> cant be extended
2. Method -> cant be overriddent
3. variable -> cant modifie the value other than constructor


    1. You can initialize a final variable when it is declared.This approach is the most common. A final variable is called blank final variable,if it is not initialized while declaration. Below are the two ways to initialize a blank final variable.
    2. A blank final variable can be initialized inside instance-initializer block or inside constructor. If you have more than one constructor in your class then it must be initialized in all of them, otherwise compile time error will be thrown.
    3. A blank final static variable can be initialized inside static block.
