What is cloning?
	Create a exact copy of the object created by not using new key work.

Why cloning is needed?
	If we are connecting to database to create instance of any object; it is costly process. 
to avoid that we can go for cloning existing object into different copies.

Different types of cloning:
	1. Shallow cloning, -> if ony if we have primitive and wrapper variables there is no issues. 
if we have the custome object reference in the class then it will create problem.

	2. Deep cloning:

		Creating the new instance of the reference variable.
