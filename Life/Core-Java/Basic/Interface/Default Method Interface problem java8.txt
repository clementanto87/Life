1. Diamond Problem: compiler will force to have provide implementation of the method in the child class.

		interface MyInterface1{
			public long getAccountNumber();
		}

		interface MyInterface2{
			public long getAccountNumber();
		}
		class MyClass implements MyInterface1,MyInterface2
		{
			//Comipler will force to provice implementation here in the child class also

			public long getAccountNumber(){
				return 1543137234531354;
			}

			MyClass cls = new MyClass();
			cls.getAccountNumber();
		}

2. If class and interface has same method -> method of the class will be give preference 

3. We can't provide implementation of system defined method in the default interface

4. For the multilevel inheritance of the same method inside the interface; child method will be called.

5. How to call the method inside in the interface if 2 interface have same methods?

					MyInterface.super().getAccountNumber()
