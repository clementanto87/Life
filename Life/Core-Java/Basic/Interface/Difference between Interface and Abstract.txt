1. Class defination:

		Abstract -> public abstract class MyClass
		Interface -> interface MyInterface

2. Class variables:
		Abstract -> Can have any non-static and non-final variable
		Interface -> Only public static final variable

3. constructor:
		Abstract -> can have constructor 
		Interface -> cant have constructor 

4. Methods:
		Abstract -> Can have non-abstract and abstract methods 
		Interface -> can only have public abstract methods

5. Easy to evolve:
		Abstract -> it is easy to evolve since we can provide implementation to the abstract class
		Interface -> its not easy to evolve 

6. Inheritance:
		Abstract -> it can extends only on class
		Interface -> it can extends any number of interfaces
