Lock: Is the concept introduced in java 1.6.

There are different types of implementations of the lock

1. private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

Advantage:
	1. We can have read or write lock here ; so incase of read multi thread can operate on the block.
	2. FAIR-NESS - policy -> it give priority to the thread waiting for longer duration time to get the CPU time for the execution.
