static:

1. class -> inner class
2. method -> it belongs to the class not object | Can be called using class name itself
	
    They can only directly call other static methods.
    They can only directly access static data.
    They cannot refer to this or super in any way.

3. variable -> belongs to class not object | it is shared between objects | ** can be applied only on the class variable
		
    We can create static variables at class-level only. See here
    static block and static variables are executed in order they are present in a program.

4. static block-> initilize the static final variable
