	wild card - bounded in java

	1.Upper Bounded Wildcards: 
	____________________________
			These wildcards can be used when you want to relax the restrictions on a variable. 
				For example, say you want to write a method that works on List < integer >, List < double >, and List < 	number > , you can do this  using an upper bounded wildcard.
		To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound.

		Less then the A -> it will accept all the child object

	2. Lower Bounded Wildcards: 
	______________________________
	It is expressed using the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>. 
	Greater then the A -> if will accpert all the parents object

	3. Unbounded Wildcard: 
	________________________

	This wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?), for example, List. This is called a list of unknown type. These are useful in the following cases

    When writing a method which can be employed using functionality provided in Object class.
    When the code is using methods in the generic class that don’t depend on the type parameter
