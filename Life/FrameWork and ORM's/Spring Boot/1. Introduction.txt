Why Spring Boot?

	Since there is some disadvantage in the spring legacy project. Spring boot came into the picture.

1. Convention over Configuration:
		Spring boot removed all the xml based configuration and provided annotation based configuration.

2. Help to develope microservice application

3. Default Server for development -> Like tomcat and jetty

4. Cloud Support

5. Support for 3rd party libarary


** Spring boot = spring - xml configuration + server
