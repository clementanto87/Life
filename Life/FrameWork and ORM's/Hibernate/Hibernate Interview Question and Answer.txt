											Hibernate Interview Question and Answers
1. ORM -> Object Relational Mapping

2. Advantage of hibernate?
		a. Open Source, ORM and database independent,
		b. High Performance -> becaue of cache machanism
		c. HQL and HCQL -> Hibernate Query Language and Hibernate criteria query language
		d. No Expertise in SQL needed
		e. Automatic table creation, update, saving with less code
		f. Provide statics

3. Hibernate Archi-tect-ure?
		Java Object ----> ORM -------> Database
		Take the java object and convert into the sql query and insert into the table.

4. Components of hibernate?
		1. Configuration
		2. SessionFactory
		3. Session -> non thread safe ( we can talk to the database )
		4. Transaction
		5. HQL 
		6. Criteria

5. hibernate.cfg.xml?
		1. datasource information,
		2. connection pool size,
		3. dialect -> what database used,
		4. cache information -> secondary caching,
		5. show_sql,
		6. hbm2ddl_auto -> create table automatically,
		7. Mapping classes,
		8. Mapping resources.

6. Dialect?
		Tell the hibernate which database, we are going to us for this application.


7. Configure hibernate using xml?
		1. Create POJO class,
		2. Create hibernate.hbm.xml corrosponding to the POJO class and map the attribute,
		3. Create hibernate.cfg.xml file,
		4. Create Session factor,
		5. Create session to save objects.

8. Hibernate in-her-itance mapping?
		1. Table per class hie-rar-chy, ( by default )
		2. Table per Concrete class,
		3. Table per sub-class.

9. What is generate class in hibernate?
		 AUTO, IDENTITY, TABLE, SEQUENCE

10. What is lazy hibernate?
		When hibenate load the data it will not load the data of composite object ; only when we explicity get the data it will load the data.

		Other words -> will not fetch the data for the child class ( composite relation )

11. What is HQL and advantage?
		Hibentate Query Language. 
				HQL independent of the database -> We are going to write the query based on the object not the table of the database.

12. HCQL -> hibernate critera Query Language | add the filter 

13. Named SQL query?
			We can name and save the query so that it can be used when we needed.

14. Caching in hibernate?
		1. First level -> session level -> it by default 
		2. Second level -> Applction leve -> have to explicitly configure it in the hibernate.cfg.xml file.

15. Different state of Object?
		1. Transient -> Object created but not linked to the session
		2. Persistence -> session.save(Object); -> once the object is joined to the session | it will keep tracking of changes 
		3. Detached -> once the session is closed it is detached.

16. Difference between get and load?
		get -> hit the database and get the result -> if no object -> null
		load -> create the proxy-object -> if no object -> objectNotFoundException

17. Difference between merge and update?
		-> update is user to update the state of the object.
		-> if the session is not available go for merger
			
			if there is no session ->it automatically merge the current data with the existing state

18. Auto dirty checking in hibernate?
			When the object is linked to the session, it will just keep tracking if the object is getting updated or not.

19. proxy - object?
		We every we call load method. proxy object is created and the object fetch the data from the server.
		It will not trigger the query unless we explicity request the state of the data.

20. Hibernate native SQL?
		Normal sql to run the queries.
